# calculator

This is a calculator project created as a part of The Odin Project's curriculum.

It performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator handles decimal input, formats results to two decimal places when necessary, and includes both delete (DEL) and all-clear (AC) functionality. It also prevents division by zero with a user alert and supports chained operations. The project employs core JavaScript skills such as functions, arrays, conditionals, and DOM manipulation, along with event delegation for efficient input handling. The user interface was built using basic HTML and CSS.
